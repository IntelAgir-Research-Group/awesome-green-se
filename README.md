<img src="img/logo_awesome_greense.png" alt="Awesome Green SE logo" width="150"/>

A meeting point for making Software Engineering greener, with a list of tools, research, and useful websites. This initiative is led by academia researchers; however, industry collaborators are more than welcome. We aim to bridge research and industry to make software development more energy‑aware and environmentally friendly.

## General

- **Mission** – Promote sustainable software practices, reduce the carbon footprint of development pipelines, and share actionable knowledge.  
- **Scope** – Covers design, coding, testing, CI/CD, cloud deployment, and other SE-related considerations.  
- **Community** – Open to students, researchers, developers, DevOps engineers, and sustainability advocates/players.
- **Core Knowledge on Green SE** - We also keep a document as a starting point for knowledge on Green SE [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dmwsnqxnqnfx#9e583b). If you want to collaborate in writing the document, ask one of the mainteiners.

## Meet Us
